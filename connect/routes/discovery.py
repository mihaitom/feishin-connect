    Coalesces concurrent callers into a single in-flight scan: two users
    opening the popover at nearly the same time (or a request-triggered
    refresh overlapping the periodic background scan in main.py) would
    otherwise each kick off their own redundant — and, for mDNS/SSDP,
    mutually interfering — scan. Everyone who calls in while a scan is
    already running just awaits that same scan's result instead.

    `verbose` logs Sonos-duplicate AirPlay/DLNA entries as they're filtered
    out — reserved for an explicit "Scan again" (see /discover below); the
    quiet background rescan every popover open triggers, and the periodic
    scan in main.py, both stay quiet. If a verbose and a non-verbose caller
    happen to coalesce onto the same in-flight scan, whichever call started
    it decides — a rare, harmless mismatch, not worth avoiding.
