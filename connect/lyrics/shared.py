"""shared.py — search-result ranking.

Port of src/main/features/core/lyrics/shared.ts (orderSearchResults), which
uses Fuse.js. The Connect backend uses the stdlib difflib instead to avoid an
extra dependency — scores are still in the Fuse convention (0 = perfect
match, 1 = worst), so the existing MATCH_THRESHOLD = 0.55 behaves the same.
