## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-09

This is the initial release of **Feishin Connect**, a fork of [jeffvli/feishin](https://github.com/jeffvli/feishin) that adds Spotify Connect-like casting to Sonos speakers and AirPlay devices — directly from the Feishin player bar.

### What's new

**Feishin Connect** adds a cast button to the player bar. Click it to stream the current Navidrome queue — or a radio stream — to any Sonos or AirPlay device on your network, without interrupting anything else.

- Stream to one or multiple Sonos / AirPlay devices simultaneously
- Sonos multiroom grouping — devices play in sync
- Per-device volume control with hover slider
- Play / pause / previous / next controls in the popover
- Radio stream support — sends the live URL directly to the device
- Persistent state — Connect keeps running if you reload Feishin in the browser
- Local playback pauses automatically when handing off to a device

### How it works

A Python / FastAPI backend runs alongside nginx in the same Docker container. It receives Navidrome credentials automatically from Feishin on startup. Feishin fetches the stream from Navidrome, re-encodes it via FFmpeg into a continuous MP3 stream, and pushes it to Sonos (UPnP / SoCo) or AirPlay (pyatv / RAOP) devices.

> This fork was developed with heavy AI assistance. Expect rough edges — please open an issue if you run into problems.

All upstream Feishin features are preserved.
